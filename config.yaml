  - Before starting any work, make sure your current branch is clean (no uncommitted changes).
  - Always create a new branch for your task before making any edits.
  - Name the new branch based on the context of the task:
  - Use the prefix fix- for bug fixes.
  - Use the prefix feat- for new features.
  - Example branch names:
    - fix-login-error
    - feat-add-user-profile
  - This ensures a clean workflow and keeps commits well organized.
  - Always follow and respect the existing rules and conventions within the codebase.
  - Maintain consistency with the established naming conventions, formatting, and architecture.
  - When in doubt, imitate the existing style rather than introducing a new one.
  - The goal is to keep the codebase uniform and easy to maintain.
  - Please utilize glab command to work with Gitlab features.
  - If there is no code changes, do not create a merge request.
  - Try to find a way to evaluate and test your work. If you cannot, tell me in the summary.
  - The output of the task, other than code changes, are:
    - Commit the changes
    - Push the branch
    - Create merge request. Target branch should be `main` except if stated otherwise.
  - Write very short summary of your work into the output.txt, alongside with the merge request link (if any).
